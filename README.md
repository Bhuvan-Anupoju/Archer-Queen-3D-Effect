# 🏹 Archer Queen 3D Effect 

#### 🔰overview

- This project demonstrates a Parallax 3D Hover Effect applied to an image card using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When a user hovers over the card, it reacts dynamically by tilting in the direction of the mouse movement, creating a smooth and realistic 3D depth illusion. The parallax behavior gives the image and its overlaying content a layered and immersive feel, enhancing the interactivity and visual appeal of the UI.

- The effect is achieved by tracking the cursor’s position relative to the card and applying CSS transform properties (like rotateX, rotateY, and translateZ) in real-time through JavaScript.
